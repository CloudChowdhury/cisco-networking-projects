## CCNA VLAN,TRUNKING & ROAS LAB (packet tracer)

``
This project is a Cisco Packet Tracer lab where I designed and configured a small enterprise network using VLANs, trunking, and Router-on-a-Stick (ROAS).  
I subnetted the 192.168.1.0/24 network into four /26 subnets and mapped them to VLANs for Sales, Engineering, HR, and Service.  
The setup includes trunk links with a native VLAN, inter-VLAN routing on the router, and SSH for secure device management.  
The goal of this lab was to reduce congestion with VLAN segmentation, optimize router interfaces using ROAS, and demonstrate end-to-end connectivity between different VLA# cisco-networking-projects.
